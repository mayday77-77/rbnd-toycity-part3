1) How long did you spend working on this project?
Ans:
A few days. Main purpose is to understand what the project requires and implement them accordingly.
Also spent time to refactor the codes and adding some additional features.

2) What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Ans:
Guess it would be some successful refactoring, shrinking some lines of code and further breaking them into smaller methods.

3) What two additional features did you build? Why?
Ans:
- Added exception handling(rescue) for the project
To learn how to rescue errors so that code can continue to function during runtime and not stop/break. 
Able to print meaningful error message as well.

- Added printing of products, customers and transactions
It will be useful to see what exactly are inside the transactions, products and customer arrays.
If there are more of them, at least we can see what do the array contain at a given time.

- A way for customers to return items
Probably good to know if you want to retract a transaction/purchase, what are the things to take note of?
And learnt more coding at the same time.

4) Where do you still have room to grow?
Ans:
To probably review and make the code more robust.
e.g What if the find methods return nil class? what if other exceptions occured?
Should we stop assigning any object attributes at all during initialization if duplicate errors occur? (can it save memory?)
